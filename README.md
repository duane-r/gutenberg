Project Gutenburg books for Minetest

This just lets you create books with actual books in them that you can read in game. Why would you want to do that? No idea. I just thought it was cool.

You should be able to download any Project Gutenburg text and save it to your mods/gutenburg/books/ directory. Then add it's file name to the init.lua and it will be available in the game.
